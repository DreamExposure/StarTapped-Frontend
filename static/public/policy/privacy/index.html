            <br>
            The Sites or Apps may contain advertisements from third parties that are not affiliated with us and which

            privacy of data you provide to any third parties. Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this

            Apps. You should review the policies of such third parties and contact them directly to respond to your

            longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.
            <br>
            When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete
            or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored
            in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
            processing until deletion is possible.
        </p>

            <br>
            We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the
            security of any personal information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that
            the internet itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information,
            transmission of personal information to and from our Sites or Apps is at your own risk. You should only
            access the services within a secure environment.
        </p>

                access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account
                at any time.</i>
            <br>
            In some regions (like the European Economic Area), you have certain rights under applicable data protection
            laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii)
            to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv)
            if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the

            below. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

            If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your
            consent at any time. Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before
            its withdrawal.
            <br>
            If you are resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal
            information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You
            can find their contact details here: <a class="text-link-color" target="_blank"

        <h6 class="text-primary">Account Information</h6>
        <p>

        <h6 class="text-primary">Cookies and similar technologies:</h6>

            Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your
            browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this

        <h3 class="text-primary" id="dnt">9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>
        <p>
            Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”)
            feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
            browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing
            DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other
            mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online
            tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised
            version of this Privacy Policy.
